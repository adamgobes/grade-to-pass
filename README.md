Simple application built with Elm that calculates the grade you need on your final exam in order to get whatever grade you want. For example if you got a 70% on your midterm that was worth 50% of your grade and your final is worth the other 50%, the application will compute that you need a 100% on your final to get an A, a 70% to get a B, a 40% to get a C, and so on. Application uses McGill University's grading scheme.
